# g-_handler
This a little tool to manage g++
Why use that thing ?

Well, you can with manage your compiles without rewrite many times your commands in g++ and don't need to find and config your system to use g++ cmd.
I'm adding a g++.conf which keep a config of your compilation and can be change at your will.
If compile has failed, you can retrieve the logs of your fail into a file, that's better to read than console !
